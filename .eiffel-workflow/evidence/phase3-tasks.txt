# Phase 3: Task Decomposition - Evidence

Project: simple_sculptor
Date: 2026-01-31
Status: COMPLETE

## Task Breakdown

24 implementation tasks defined across 5 layers:

LAYER 0 - Utility Classes (4 tasks):
  Task 01: SCULPTOR_POINT_3D
  Task 02: SCULPTOR_VECTOR_3D
  Task 03: TEXT_PROMPT
  Task 04: BOUNDING_BOX_3D

LAYER 1 - Data Structures (3 tasks):
  Task 05: POINT_CLOUD
  Task 06: MESH_VALIDATION_REPORT
  Task 07: SCULPTOR_CONFIG

LAYER 2 - Core Logic (3 tasks):
  Task 08: SCULPTOR_RESULT
  Task 09: SCULPTOR_INFERENCE_RESULT
  Task 10: MESH_CONVERTER

LAYER 3 - System Integration (3 tasks):
  Task 11: SCULPTOR_EXPORTER
  Task 12: SCULPTOR_MESH
  Task 13: SCULPTOR_ENGINE

LAYER 4 - Public API (1 task):
  Task 14: SIMPLE_SCULPTOR

LAYER 5 - Integration & Testing (10 tasks):
  Task 15: Configuration Pipeline
  Task 16: Model Lifecycle
  Task 17: Generation Pipeline
  Task 18: Mesh Validation
  Task 19: Error Handling
  Task 20: Unit Test - SCULPTOR_POINT_3D
  Task 21: Unit Test - POINT_CLOUD
  Task 22: Unit Test - SCULPTOR_MESH
  Task 23: Unit Test - MESH_CONVERTER
  Task 24: Full Pipeline Integration Test

## Acceptance Criteria

All 24 tasks have explicit acceptance criteria derived from Phase 2 postconditions:
- 180+ specific acceptance conditions
- Each postcondition becomes a test
- Each invariant becomes a validation
- Frame conditions become side-effect tests

## Dependencies

Layer-based dependency model:
- Layer 0: No dependencies (parallelizable)
- Layer 1: Depends on Layer 0 (4 tasks parallel)
- Layer 2: Depends on Layer 0-1 (3 tasks parallel)
- Layer 3: Depends on Layer 0-2 (3 tasks parallel)
- Layer 4: Depends on all layers (1 task sequential)
- Layer 5: Depends on Layer 4 (10 tasks parallel)

## Implementation Strategy

Recommended execution:
1. Implement Layers 0-1 in parallel (7 tasks) - 4-5 hours
2. Implement Layers 2-3 in parallel (6 tasks) - 4-5 hours
3. Implement Layer 4 (1 task) - 2-3 hours
4. Implement Layer 5 in parallel (10 tasks) - 2-3 hours

Total estimated effort: 12-16 hours
Actual effort may vary based on ONNX integration complexity

## Completion Criteria for Phase 4

✓ All 24 tasks have acceptance criteria met
✓ All 26 test methods passing
✓ 100% test pass rate
✓ Zero assertion failures on postconditions
✓ Zero violations of invariants
✓ TEST_APP test runner exits with success

## Documentation

Full task descriptions with acceptance criteria in:
.eiffel-workflow/PHASE3_TASKS.md

Each task includes:
- Clear description
- All acceptance criteria (from postconditions)
- Implementation notes
- Dependencies

Status: READY FOR PHASE 4 IMPLEMENTATION
